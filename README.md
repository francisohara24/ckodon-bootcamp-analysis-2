# sat-bootcamp-analysis-2
Data analysis project I worked on to organize new cohort of students at the Ckodon Foundation.

### Goals
The project imports student data collected via Google Forms and randomly assigns a group to each student that filled the form.

Each student's assigned group is then emailed to them individually alongside a link they can use to join a WhatsApp group created for their assigned group.
